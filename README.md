# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Creates a model that predicts churn for Telecommunications customers and tests the model.<br>
Relies on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.
## Results ##
Accuracy: 0.79<br>
ROC AUC 0.83<br>
Features positively correlating with churn were the number of total charges, the number of monthly charges, and using fiber optic internet service. Features negatively correlating with churn were number of months of tenure, having two-year or one-year contracts, using phone service, recieving tech support, not receiving internet service, and receiving online security.
## Reccomendations ##
My reccomendations include focusing on retaining short-term customers and those using fiber-optic internet service. Short-term customers should be incentivized to enter long-term contracts and service quality for fiber-optic customers should be improved.
